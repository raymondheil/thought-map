# thought-map

An idea for a thought map app that I had. Who knows, maybe I'll even do it for
real someday!

Okay so I had to take notes in a thought map for one of my classes, and I
realized that it feels much easier to do when I don't have to worry about having
an order to my thoughts. Rather, I want to focus on connections. So that's cool!

# Current thoughts (bulleted list because I haven't made the app, lol)

- You can enter ideas in no particular order

- It's easy to specify when things connect to each other

- There's a way to get an overview of the "big topics" as you create them. They
  should be dynamically found, not something you need to define yourself!

- A way to see your whole map so far. Who knows, maybe this is a GUI app?
  Although that'd be something so completely new I'd have no idea how to start.

  - tkinter?

# Workflow

- Start a new project, which will be saved/encoded in its own file

- See something interesting in the reading and add it

- See something else completely different and add that

- Notice a third thing and add it.

- The third thing actually helps you connect the first two conceptually. Make
  connections between them!

- Keep on reading

- At the end, be able to see your most-connected thoughts and maybe a whole map
  of the thing.
